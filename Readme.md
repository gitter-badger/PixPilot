# Readme

PixPilot is a library and collection of telemetry screens (and maybe even a GCS replacement sometime in the future) for radios running OpenTX >=2.2.

PixPilot comes as a package of telemetry screens and adapters.
While the adapters parse telemetry data from various flight controllers (PX4, Arducopter, Arduplane, Taulabs, Cleanflight, DJI and more to come) as well as different telemetry protocols, the user can select between various telemetry screens that will work independent from the flight controller and telemetry protocol.

Support for PX4 is currently in work. See the [relevant pull request](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/pull/4361).

Support for Arducopter will be added once they have implemented [the relevant PR](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/issues/1587).

Thanks to ilihack, SockEye, Richardoe, Schicksie, lichtl, ben_&Jace25, Clooney82&fnoopdogg for their previous work.
